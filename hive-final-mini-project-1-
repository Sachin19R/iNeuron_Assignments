3. List of all agents' names. 

hive> select distinct(agent_name) from agent_performance;


4. Find out agent average rating.

hive> select agent_name,avg(avg_rating) as Overall_rating
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name;

5. Total working days for each agents 

hive> select x.agent,sum(x.date) as total_woring_days
    > from (
    > select agent,count(distinct(date)) as date
    > from agent_loging_report
    > group by agent,date) as x
    > group by x.agent;

6. Total query that each agent have taken 

hive> select agent_name,sum(total_chats) as total_queries_taken
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name;


7. Total Feedback that each agent have received 

hive> select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name;

8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4 

hive> select x.agent_name
    > from (
    > select agent_name,avg(avg_rating) as Overall_rating
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name) as x
    > where x.overall_rating between 3.5 and 4;

9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 

hive> select x.agent_name
    > from (
    > select agent_name,avg(avg_rating) as Overall_rating
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name) as x
    > where x.overall_rating < 3.5;

10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5 

hive> select x.agent_name
    > from (
    > select agent_name,avg(avg_rating) as Overall_rating
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name) as x
    > where x.overall_rating > 4.5;

11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average

hive> select agent_name , sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback
    > from agent_performance
    > where avg_rating > 4.5
    > group by agent_name;

12. average weekly response time for each agent 


13. average weekly resolution time for each agents 


14. Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback

hive> select agent_name,
    > sum(total_chats) as queries_attended,
    > sum(total_feedback) as feedback_recived
    > from agent_performance
    > group by agent_name;

15. Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basisT 
16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.
17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.
